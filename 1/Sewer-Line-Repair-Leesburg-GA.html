<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or long-term connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
