<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
