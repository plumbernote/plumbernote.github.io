When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. Because of the tight space, the pipes typically make unusual gurgling noises as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the weird noises emanating from your sink.</p>
