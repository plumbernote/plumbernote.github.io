<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
