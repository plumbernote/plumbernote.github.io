<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to become soggy. You may smell the revolting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that part of your lawn. The circumstance is laden with problems because the swampiness will bring in unwelcome animals. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or permanent connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds.

A professional plumber will be able to precisely find the source of the leak and advise the best option. However, if the water heater is beyond repair it might be time to think about setting up a brand-new system.</p>
