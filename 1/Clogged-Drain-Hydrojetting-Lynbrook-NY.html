<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. However discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are typically available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
