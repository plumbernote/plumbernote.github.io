<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
