<p>It is not constantly due to blockages that come from inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise known as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger considerable problems and damage-- especially typical in older houses.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
