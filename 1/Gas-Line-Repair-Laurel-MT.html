<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.

<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be a sign of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage smell in your home, it is crucial that you get in touch with a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can pose serious health threats.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
