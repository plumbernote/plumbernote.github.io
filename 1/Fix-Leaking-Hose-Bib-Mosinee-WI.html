<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you ought to only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>Frequently brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a defective fill valve may actuate periodically, too. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand and model of your toilet. The brand is usually on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become an experimental procedure. Even professional plumbers often try 2 or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
