<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Dallas North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.
