<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
