Intrusive tree roots can cause major plumbing problems, particularly in older neighborhoods with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is fairly new, you might need to switch toilet tissue or employ a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
