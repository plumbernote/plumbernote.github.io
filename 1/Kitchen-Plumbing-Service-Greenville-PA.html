<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Greenville PA</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
