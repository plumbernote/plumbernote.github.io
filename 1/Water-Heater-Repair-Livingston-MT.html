<p>The part expenses around $14 per drip leg, and you may be able to install it yourself as a Do It Yourself project. You won't have water areas. Difficult water leaves water spots on dishes, glasses, and utensils whether you are washing them by hand or in a dishwasher. Soft water looks after this by minimizing the minerals in the water.
