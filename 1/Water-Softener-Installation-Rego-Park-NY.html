<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up during construction of a new or renovated building is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining pipes fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can cause detrimental damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
