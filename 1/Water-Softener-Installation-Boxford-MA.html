<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs numerous items to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated. The installation must be assessed to ensure it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test information need to be collected to figure out the workings of each part. The backflow prevention assembly need to be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow chart is required to ensure it was repaired effectively.

Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly protected, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
