PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which implies plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves time and money and minimizes the danger of joint leakages. PEX also withstands rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>
