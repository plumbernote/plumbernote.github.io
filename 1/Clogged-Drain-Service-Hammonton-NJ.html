<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another tip to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
