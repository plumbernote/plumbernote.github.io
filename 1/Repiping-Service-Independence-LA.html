<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in Independence</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater far from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home. A broken gas line is an extremely severe issue, and sometimes a problem will emerge at the most bothersome times. Regrettably, not all plumbing specialists will accept service calls after hours, leaving property owners uncertain and annoyed what to do. At Mr. Rooter Plumbing of Pittsburgh, we make certain that our consumers are safe and satisfied at all times. That's why we offer 24 hour emergency services for local Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area house and company owner. If you face a last minute concern, call our office anytime and we will send a rescue group to your place immediately, 24 hr a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
