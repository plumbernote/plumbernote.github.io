Most of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
