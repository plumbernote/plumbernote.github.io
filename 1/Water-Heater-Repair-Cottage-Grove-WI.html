<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
