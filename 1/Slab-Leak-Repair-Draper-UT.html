<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation visit. Setting up natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As tough water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger difficult water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
