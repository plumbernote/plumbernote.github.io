Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
