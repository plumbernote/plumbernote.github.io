<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Amory MS</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
