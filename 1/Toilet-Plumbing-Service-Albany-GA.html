Check for damages and holes if your tank is relatively brand-new and you have this issue. Assess your backyard for any intrusive tree roots. Transplant these plants, if possible, to keep roots far from your plumbing. Underground pipes can be expensive to replace or repair.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative offers better, much safer drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will delight in healthier skin and hair. Sewer lines that need to be changed or fixed due to blockages, tree roots, or other issues are often accompanied by a variety of concerns such as bad smells, water backing up and bubbles coming through your drain.</p>
