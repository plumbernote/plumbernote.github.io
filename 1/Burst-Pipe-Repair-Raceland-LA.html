Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents pollutants or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water system.
