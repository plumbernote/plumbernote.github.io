<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
