<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
