Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

Since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
