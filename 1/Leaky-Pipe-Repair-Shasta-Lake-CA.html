It is important that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
