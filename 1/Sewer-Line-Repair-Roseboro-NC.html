During regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>

With a patented chlorine generator, our superior systems likewise offer an automatic cleaning cycle.
