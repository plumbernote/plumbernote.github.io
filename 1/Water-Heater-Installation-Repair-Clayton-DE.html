<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Clayton DE</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
