<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are extremely important to constructing a reputation for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water supply within a structure these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
