<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might happen. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>
