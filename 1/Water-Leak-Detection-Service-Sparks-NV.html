Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the issue.
