Water pressure might be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
