<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task because of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
