<p>Once set up, these BPAs are subject to initial and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional efficiency.

Licensing, registration and other tester-specific details is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
