<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
