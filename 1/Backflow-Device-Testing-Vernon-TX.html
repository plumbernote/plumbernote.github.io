<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
