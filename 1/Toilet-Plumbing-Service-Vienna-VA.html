<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing information.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
