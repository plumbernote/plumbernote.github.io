<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
