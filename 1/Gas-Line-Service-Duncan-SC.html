We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
