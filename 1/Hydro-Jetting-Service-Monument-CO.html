An upright cylindrical tank that heats up a set amount of water, with either gas or electricity, and is readily available when your faucets and shower need it. It's a very quickly, effective method that has been the standard for several years. The integrated water and space heaters are a reliable and effective option that can be utilized to warm up the house as well as heat water for domestic functions.</p>
