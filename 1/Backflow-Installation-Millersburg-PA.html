<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system providing the cosmetics water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>

These devices consist of backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches.
