<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
