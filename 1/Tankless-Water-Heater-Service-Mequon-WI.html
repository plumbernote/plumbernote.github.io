This repair method is usually used to replace the old pipe with a similar or larger pipe.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
