When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
