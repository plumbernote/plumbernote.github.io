The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can.
