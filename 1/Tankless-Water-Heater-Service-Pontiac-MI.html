Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
