<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
