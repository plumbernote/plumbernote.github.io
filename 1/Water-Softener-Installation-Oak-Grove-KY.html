<p>Set up 50 gallon electrical hot water heater and thermal expansion tank. When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to notice gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or odd smells.

<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced.
