For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
