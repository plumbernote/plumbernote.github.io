<p>Since of the inherent style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static circulation condition may cause nuisance leaking and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
