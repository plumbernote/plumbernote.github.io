<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
