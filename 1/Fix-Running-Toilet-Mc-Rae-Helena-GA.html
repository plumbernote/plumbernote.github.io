The reasons for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or defective electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned concerns, a repair or replacement of the parts might be enough. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening often, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>

You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop.
