<p>The most reliable method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Malfunctions: Modern hot water heater likewise depend on electrical elements. You could be left with no hot water if something inside the system fails The discharge line is pressurized and can run some range. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make better connection than running exterior.</p>
