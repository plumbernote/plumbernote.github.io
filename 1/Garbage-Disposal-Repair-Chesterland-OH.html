<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items including harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
