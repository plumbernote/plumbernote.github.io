<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

New gas line installation costs $12 to $25 per direct foot, consisting of labor, materials, piping, and allows.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
