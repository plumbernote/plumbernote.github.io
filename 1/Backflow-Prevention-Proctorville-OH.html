<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).
