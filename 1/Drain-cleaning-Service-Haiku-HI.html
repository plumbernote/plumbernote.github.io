<p>One common method for a house's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread out exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>
<p>Though it's not always necessary, in some cases the plumber may need to update or repair circuitry to power the new waste disposal unit. This typically costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be tarnished or degraded if the gas line is damaged. Contact our specialists to figure out the level of the problem.</p>
