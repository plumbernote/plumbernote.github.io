Water pressure might be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Water softeners normally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately preserved.
