Even little leakages can gradually moisten walls and floorings until they end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other allergens. Old galvanized iron pipes may end up being rusty and add rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes. An unusual, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good indication. Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
