<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. However finding the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
