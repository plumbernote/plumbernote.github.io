Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>

<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen over time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining properly. You can combat hard water in numerous methods, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
