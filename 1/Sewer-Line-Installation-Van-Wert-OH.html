This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
