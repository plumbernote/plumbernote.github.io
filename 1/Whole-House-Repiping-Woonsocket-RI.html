<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the option is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is essential to solve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>The sewer camera inspection permits you to really see the interior condition of the drain line. It likewise lets you see the product the drain line is made from. You can tell if the problem with your drain line is in a particular area, or if the whole line or a portion of the sewer line requires replacing. If there is a break in the line, the camera not only verifies the place of the break but allows you to see the nature of the break, too. When planning to link another sewer into the line, a camera can also be used to visually inspect the condition of a sewer line. It can also be used for pre-house sales or whenever the need arises to verify that a sewer remains in great condition.</p>
