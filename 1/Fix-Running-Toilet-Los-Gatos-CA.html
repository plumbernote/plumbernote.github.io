<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus removing solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential problem with the water heater. It can also suggest the hot water heater is near completion of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old. With heavy deterioration buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might indicate that there have actually been variations in pressure causing small leaks.</p>
