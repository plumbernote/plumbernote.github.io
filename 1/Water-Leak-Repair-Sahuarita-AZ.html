If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades before that, opportunities are that your house may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>
