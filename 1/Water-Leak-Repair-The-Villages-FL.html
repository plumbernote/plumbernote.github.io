<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
