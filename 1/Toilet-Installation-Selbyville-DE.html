<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
