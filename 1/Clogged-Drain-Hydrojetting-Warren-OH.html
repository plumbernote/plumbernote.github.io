With toilets, the pro will check water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. She or he will eyeball visible pipes, and might run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
