<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair.

The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt.

If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
