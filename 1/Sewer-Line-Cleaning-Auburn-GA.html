<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
