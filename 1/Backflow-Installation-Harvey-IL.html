Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
