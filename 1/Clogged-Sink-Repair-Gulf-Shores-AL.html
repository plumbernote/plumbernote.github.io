<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles however will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
