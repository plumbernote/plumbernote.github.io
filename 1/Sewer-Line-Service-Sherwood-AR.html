Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
