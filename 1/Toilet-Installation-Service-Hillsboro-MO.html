<p>If you want it to work well for years to come, your garbage disposal installation needs to be brought out by a professional plumber. It is a reasonably simple device that sucks food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are small enough, they go through to the remainder of the wastewater to be gotten rid of. It generally uses up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side if you have a battle drain setup.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. In some cases drain repair requirements can be resolved fairly rapidly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be taken apart, taken a look at, and cleared before being changed. In many cases, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is necessary (like a pvc, reducer, or tailpiece trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to talk about repair options.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
