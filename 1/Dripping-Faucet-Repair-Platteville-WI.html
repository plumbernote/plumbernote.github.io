<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider. A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. As soon as linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
