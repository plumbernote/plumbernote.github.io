<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job since of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
