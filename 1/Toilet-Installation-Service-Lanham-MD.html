<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>Plumbers typically start as apprentices. From there, they check and earn a journey plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground zero for obstructions. As hair combines with soap, it can develop the perfect storm for plumbing clogs. In time, these obstructions can worsen and prevent your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
