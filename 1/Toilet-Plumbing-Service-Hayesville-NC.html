<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and pretty inexpensive to install, so there's no reason not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow. This added with other particles in your drain can trigger a major backup.</p>
