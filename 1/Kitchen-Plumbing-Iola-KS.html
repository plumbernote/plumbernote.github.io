The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

When the source and place of the leak has actually been identified, we'll get to work carrying out any required repairs or replace the drain totally if needed.
