It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
