Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they don't wear out as quick.</p>
<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you ought to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
