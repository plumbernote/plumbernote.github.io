<p>Frequently triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a defective fill valve may activate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
