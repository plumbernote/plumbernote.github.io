<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and rust. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older areas where clay pipe might have been utilized.

Repiping now will give you peace of mind and prevent bigger leaks down the road.</p>

To prevent this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
