<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.
