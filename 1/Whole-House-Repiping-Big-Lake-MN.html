<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But discovering the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are typically readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Warm water is no longer a luxury-- it's a requirement.

If you're having problems with your existing hot water heater-- or you need to get a new one-- don't attempt to handle it alone.  Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>
