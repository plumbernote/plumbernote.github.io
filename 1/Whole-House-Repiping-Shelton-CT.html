<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Company in Shelton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Hard water can leave your hair looking dry and dull and your skin feeling itchy and flakey, which's only what it does to your body. In your house, hard water mineral build-up on faucets and showerheads causes them to lose effectiveness and function, and etching and spotting on your glassware makes it look like you never even ran the dishwasher.</p>
