<p>In truth, that's how tough water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind. Gradually these deposits can collect, clog, or perhaps wear away pipes and trigger major plumbing problems. Tough water deposits can build up in boilers and hot water heaters, making them less effective and more expensive to use Toilets have moving parts, and moving parts wear out or break. If your toilet will not stop running, attempt repairing or replacing these crucial toilet parts.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
