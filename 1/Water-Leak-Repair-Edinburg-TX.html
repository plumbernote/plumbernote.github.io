<h3>Blocked Drain Cleaning: Why Hire A Professional in Edinburg TX 78542?</h3>
<p>First consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be required. Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better option.

<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
