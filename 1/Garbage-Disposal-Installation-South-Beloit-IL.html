Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
