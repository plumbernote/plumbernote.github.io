<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of corrosion, request that a new one be installed.</p>
