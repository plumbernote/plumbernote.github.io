However the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of solidity minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
