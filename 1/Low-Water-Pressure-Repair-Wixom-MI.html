<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Wixom MI</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
