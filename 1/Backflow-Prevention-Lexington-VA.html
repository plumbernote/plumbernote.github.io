<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Our professional plumbers provide preventive maintenance, plumbing repairs and emergency maintenance When you request a preventative maintenance service call, you can expect us to completely inspect your plumbing pipes for signs of leakages, deterioration and broken or malfunctioning water-using home appliances, like toilets, showers, sinks and hot water heater.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
