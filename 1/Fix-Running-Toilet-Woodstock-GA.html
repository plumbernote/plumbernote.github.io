Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink.

If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
