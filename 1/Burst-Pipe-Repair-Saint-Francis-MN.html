<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Saint Francis MN 55070</h3>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
