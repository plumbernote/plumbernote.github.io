<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
