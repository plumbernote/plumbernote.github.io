<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>

The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water main. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
