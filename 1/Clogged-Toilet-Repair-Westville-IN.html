<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.

A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
