<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Call a trustworthy and knowledgeable  plumber for your plumbing problems. Do-it-yourself plumbing is not constantly the best route, especially for more complex plumbing problems.

<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you use PEX, copper, or another product.
