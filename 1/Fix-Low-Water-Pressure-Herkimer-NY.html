<p>Lots of property owners believe their utility companies or homeowners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are accountable. Most basic property owners insurance coverage and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your home.</p>
