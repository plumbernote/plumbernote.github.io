Sometimes easy repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to take a look at your scenario and inform you what needs to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the bill.
