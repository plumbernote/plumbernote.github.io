It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
