<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
