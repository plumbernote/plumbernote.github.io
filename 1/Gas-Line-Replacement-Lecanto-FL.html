<p>Supply of water by the public utility includes some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional expenses. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>

As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.
