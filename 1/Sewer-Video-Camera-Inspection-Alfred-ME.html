<p>Numerous house owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their filthy or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are simple to utilize and inexpensive, but they damage your pipes and their effects are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
