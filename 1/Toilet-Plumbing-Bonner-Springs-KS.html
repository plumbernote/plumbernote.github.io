By 2011, after 5 years of study, Stegle had his journeyman license, was all set to set off on his own, and opened Stegle Plumbing, based in Anna, Illinois. His strategy was to provide a total range of services.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it immediately becomes a severe security risk.
