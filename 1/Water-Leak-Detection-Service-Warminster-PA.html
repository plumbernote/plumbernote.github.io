<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
