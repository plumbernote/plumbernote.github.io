<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
