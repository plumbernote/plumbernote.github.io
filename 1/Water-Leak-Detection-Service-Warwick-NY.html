<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
