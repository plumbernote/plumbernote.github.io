For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or possible connection in between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can allow impurities or contaminants to go into the safe and clean water system. Sickness can arise from ingesting water that has actually been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
