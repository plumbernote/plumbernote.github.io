<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or company, and its capability to function is important. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root invasion or a big clog.

Small blockages can develop into big ones fairly rapidly.</p>

<p>When sewer line breaks, it frequently causes the lawn above it to end up being soggy. You might smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!).

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
