<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
