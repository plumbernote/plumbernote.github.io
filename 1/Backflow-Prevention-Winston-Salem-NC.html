<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Winston Salem NC</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>
