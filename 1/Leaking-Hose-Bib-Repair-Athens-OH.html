<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
