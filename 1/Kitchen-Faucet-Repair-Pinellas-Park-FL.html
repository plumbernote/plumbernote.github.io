<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
