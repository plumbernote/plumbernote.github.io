Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
