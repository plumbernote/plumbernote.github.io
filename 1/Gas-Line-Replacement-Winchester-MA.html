Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
