<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
