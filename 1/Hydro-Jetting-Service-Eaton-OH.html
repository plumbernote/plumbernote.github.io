<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
