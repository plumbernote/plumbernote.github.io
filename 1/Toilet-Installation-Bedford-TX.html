Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you must wait until after the cycle is finished and after that examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should likewise check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
