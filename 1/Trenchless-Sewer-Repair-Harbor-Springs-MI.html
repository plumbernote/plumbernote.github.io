<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to eliminate.
