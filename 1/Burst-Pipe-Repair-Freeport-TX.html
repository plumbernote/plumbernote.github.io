<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
