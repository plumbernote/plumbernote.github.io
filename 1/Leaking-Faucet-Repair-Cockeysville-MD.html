A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific homes, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
