<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable results. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety precaution, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers natural gas an odor frequently connected with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinct fragrance permits you to smell a possible leak. Always leave if you presume a leak.</p>
<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about really low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
