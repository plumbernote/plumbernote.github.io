<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more damaging than valuable, possibly gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run due to the fact that it might resolve the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>There are two broad classifications of sources of potential cross contamination: internal and external. Internal sources consist of the previously mentioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning jobs, and appliances such as dish washers, hot water tanks, radiant water heater, and so on. External sources include rain water run-off from roofings and car park, groundwater, puddles of surface water, hygienic sewer pipelines, other supply of water pipelines, sewage-disposal tanks, underground tank and cisterns, irrigation pipelines and ditches, fish ponds, natural bodies of water, sprinkler system, agricultural run-off from animal lots, drainage from compost piles, buried or aboveground chemical storage tanks, gray water from water recycling systems, and backup of combined overflow drains throughout heavy rainfall events into structure foundations and basements.</p>
