For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>On its own, gas is colorless and odorless. The majority of utility companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from. That way, you can easily inform if you have a gas leak.
