<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
