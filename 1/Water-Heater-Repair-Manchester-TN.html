<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more harmful than valuable, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
