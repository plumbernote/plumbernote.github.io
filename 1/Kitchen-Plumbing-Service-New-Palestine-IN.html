<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
