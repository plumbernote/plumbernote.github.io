Capability is important when picking a tankless design, so you ought to constantly speak with a professional plumber before buying.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
