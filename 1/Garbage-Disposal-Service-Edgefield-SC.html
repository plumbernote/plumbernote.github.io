<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
