<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Tabor City NC</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>
