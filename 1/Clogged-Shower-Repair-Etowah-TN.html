<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an important part in a sophisticated system that has been designed and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run off from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems.
