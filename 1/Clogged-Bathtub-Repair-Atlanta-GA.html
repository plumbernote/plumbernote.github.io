Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
