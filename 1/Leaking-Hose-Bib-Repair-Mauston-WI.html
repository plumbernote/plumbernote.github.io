<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
