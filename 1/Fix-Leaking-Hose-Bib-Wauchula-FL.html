<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This big amount of garbage does not need to enter the trash bin if it can quickly and rapidly be gotten rid of through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to land fills and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>
