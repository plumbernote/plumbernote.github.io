<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl).

If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
