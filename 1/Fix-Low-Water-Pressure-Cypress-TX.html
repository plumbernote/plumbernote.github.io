<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
