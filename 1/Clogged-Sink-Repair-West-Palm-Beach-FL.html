<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
