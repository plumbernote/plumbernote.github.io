A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
