<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high cost makes it unwise as a household solution.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
