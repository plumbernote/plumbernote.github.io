<p>This warranty certifies and represents all other warranties to the customer, whether expressed or implied. This warranty disclaims without limitation implied guarantees of merchantability or physical fitness for a specific purpose or treatment of certain water conditions. Whether you need to prepare food, wash your hands, soak in the shower or a hot bath, or simply mop the floor, both your household water heating system and the flow of natural gas contribute important aspects to your household's level of daily convenience and benefit.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
