Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on security within a structure. Plumbing inspections ensure that water systems in buildings are connected properly, with no cross-connection to infect potable water systems. Fixtures need to be appropriately trapped, to avoid sewer gas from escaping into a buildings. Warm water heaters are likewise checked to make certain that they have actually been set up effectively, to avoid an explosion.</p>

A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>
