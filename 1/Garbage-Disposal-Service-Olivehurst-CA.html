<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
