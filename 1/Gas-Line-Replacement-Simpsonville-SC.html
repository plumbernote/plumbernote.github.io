<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Simpsonville SC</h3>
<p>Inspections prevent a high portion of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run properly. It is necessary to make sure there is always 2 feet of clearance around it. You must also drain about 25 percent of your tank frequently (a couple of times each year). This will help get rid of any sediment that has settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
