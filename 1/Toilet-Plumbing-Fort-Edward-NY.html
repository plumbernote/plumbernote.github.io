Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as a result mean that the level of protection on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high threat protection level.</p>
