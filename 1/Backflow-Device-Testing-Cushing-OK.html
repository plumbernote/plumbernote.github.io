<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
