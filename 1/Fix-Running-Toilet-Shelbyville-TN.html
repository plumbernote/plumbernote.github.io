<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
