    <meta name="description" content="Plumbing Contractors Orland Park Illinois - The purpose of a sewer camera is to be able to see what's causing a blockage or backup within the sewer pipe without digging up the yard or just guessing what the problem is. Because sewer repairs and pipe replacements are no small task, this helps homeowners avoid expensive repairs without knowing for certain that their problem will be solved when the work is done.">

The new pipes that are used are generally made from copper since of their resilience and other elements. Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
