However, most of toilet repairs are simple and uncomplicated jobs - such as replacing a worn flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in reality, necessary day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating taste many people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this moment the water is stated to be difficult.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a major safety concern. Don't take any chances. Make certain the softener is set to the firmness of your water supply. If the solidity is set too high, the softener will cost more to squander and operate water, costing you additional money. Our plumbers have the expertise and qualifications to handle any plumbing repair or installation rapidly and securely.</p>
