All replacements need to be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly must fulfill the lead totally free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be ceased till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out yearly forward circulation tests are in some cases viewed as a required to have them. However the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
