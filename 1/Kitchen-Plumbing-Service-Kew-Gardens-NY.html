Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
