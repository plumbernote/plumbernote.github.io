<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction effect and draw prospective contaminants into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are typically discovered in most houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
