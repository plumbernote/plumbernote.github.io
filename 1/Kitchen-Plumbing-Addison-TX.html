<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
