<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
