<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
