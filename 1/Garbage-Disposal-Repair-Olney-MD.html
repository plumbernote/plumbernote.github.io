<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective working a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
