<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
