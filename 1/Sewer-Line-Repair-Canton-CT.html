<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has been in location given that your house was constructed so it is about the very same age as your house.

Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk protection assembly.</p>

The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
