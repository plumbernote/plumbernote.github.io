As a safety preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas a smell frequently connected with rotten eggs. This distinct fragrance allows you to smell a potential leak if it occurs. Constantly leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>This is extremely important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
