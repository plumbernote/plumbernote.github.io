<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and available for usage. Also, rust of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of deterioration.</p>

Salt will not trigger lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered extremely low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
