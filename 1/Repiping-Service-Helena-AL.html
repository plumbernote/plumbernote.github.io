<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal.

<p>Keeping your garbage dispoal clean isn't very tough or time consuming. Fill the sink a minimum of half full of soapy water. Get rid of the stopper from the drain while at the same time turning on the disposal. This will fill the whole disposal with soapy water and assistance to flush out food buildup. It will also clean the blades and flush your pipes with clean water.</p>
