Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is hooked up to its install. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
