<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
<p>Frequently caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, often a defective fill valve may actuate periodically, as well.
