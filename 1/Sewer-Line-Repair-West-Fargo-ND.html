<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the professional to properly analyze conditions and identify the performance of the pipes. The info we obtain from the inspection enables us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option too.
