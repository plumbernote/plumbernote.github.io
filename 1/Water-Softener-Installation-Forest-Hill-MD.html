<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
