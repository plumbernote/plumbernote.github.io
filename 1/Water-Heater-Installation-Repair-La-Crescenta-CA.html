<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
