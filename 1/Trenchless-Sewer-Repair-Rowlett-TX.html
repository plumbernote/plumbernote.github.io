<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual circulation, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature or pressure might need replacing the water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
