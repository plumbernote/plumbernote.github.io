<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
