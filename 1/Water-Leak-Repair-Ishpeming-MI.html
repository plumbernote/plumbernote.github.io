An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>
