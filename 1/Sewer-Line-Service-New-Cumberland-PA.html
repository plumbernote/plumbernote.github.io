<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Examine the house's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age.
