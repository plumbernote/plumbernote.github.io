<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Buena Park CA</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
