<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being.

<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking.
