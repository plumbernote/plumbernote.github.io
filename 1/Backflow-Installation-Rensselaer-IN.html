Applications range from softening in remote areas to resolving issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for waste disposal unit are given up horsepower, or HP. These correspond straight to how much waste the unit can manage, and suggested sizes are typically based upon the number of users are in a household.

<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
