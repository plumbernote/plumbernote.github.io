Pull the auger out occasionally to eliminate debris until it moves past the obstruction without resistance.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular impurities that residents are handling and an RO can help reduce those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
