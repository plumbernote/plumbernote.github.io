Residences built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health dangers connected with lead.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
