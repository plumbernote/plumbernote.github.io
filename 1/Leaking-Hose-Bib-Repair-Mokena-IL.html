<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
