<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.
