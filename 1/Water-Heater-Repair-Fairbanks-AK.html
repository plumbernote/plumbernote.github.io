<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread polluted water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection in between the public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can allow pollutants or contaminants to go into the safe and clean water system. Sickness can result from ingesting water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>

<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Fairbanks AK</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
