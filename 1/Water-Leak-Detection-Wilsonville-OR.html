<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
