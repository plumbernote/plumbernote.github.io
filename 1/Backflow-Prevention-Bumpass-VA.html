<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
