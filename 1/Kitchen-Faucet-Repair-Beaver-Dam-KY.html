<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
