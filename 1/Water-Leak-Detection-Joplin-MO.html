In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
