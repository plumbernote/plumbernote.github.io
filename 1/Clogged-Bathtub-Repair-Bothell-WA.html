<p>While pipe lining is a great alternative for most people, there are some situations where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the process of replacing old corroded pipes with lasting and durable brand-new pipes. Because of their toughness and other factors, the new pipes that are used are typically made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
