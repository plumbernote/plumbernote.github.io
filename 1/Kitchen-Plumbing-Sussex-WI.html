<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC.

The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
