<p>Frequently triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, in some cases a faulty fill valve might actuate periodically, too. Water will not drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
