<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in Iowa City IA 52240</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to obstructions that stem inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
