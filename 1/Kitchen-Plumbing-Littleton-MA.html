The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not been able to identify requirements for these products and report irregular efficiency to date.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
