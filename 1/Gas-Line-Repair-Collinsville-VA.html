<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Remember, that bigger motors not only cost more to buy, they also cost more to run. Larger systems might also burn out faster over time, so it's best to get the smallest unit that will accommodate your requirements. .

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
