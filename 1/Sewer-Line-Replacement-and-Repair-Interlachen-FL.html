<p>If you've always resided in an area with tough water, you might not realize just how much it impacts you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
