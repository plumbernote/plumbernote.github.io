<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>

If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
