<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
