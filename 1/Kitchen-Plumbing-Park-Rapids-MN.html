<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
