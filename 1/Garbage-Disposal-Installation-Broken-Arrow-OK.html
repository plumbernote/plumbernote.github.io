It probably goes without stating that leaking pipes should be replaced immediately. It might be regular to have condensation on warm water pipes, however it's certainly not typical for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>There are health and safety risks one must avoid while dealing with a sewer line job. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are found in sewer pipes and may expose workers throughout the sewer repair procedure. If your DIY dig hits a gas line, breathing the gas can harm your body, and there is a threat of fire or explosion damage to your property or your next-door neighbor's. Another threat in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your safety and health are too important to risk in a DIY sewer task! Avoid these safety dangers by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
