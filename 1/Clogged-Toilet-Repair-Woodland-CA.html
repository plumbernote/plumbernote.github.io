The factors for this can range from leaks, defective or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the elements may suffice if it is one of the mentioned concerns. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring often, then a hot water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
