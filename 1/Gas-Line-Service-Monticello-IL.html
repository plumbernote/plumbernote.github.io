Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
