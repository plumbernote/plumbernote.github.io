Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
