The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to minimize individual, and structural electrical hazards. Initially call your local energy company then call a plumber if you presume a gas leak. Licensed professional plumbers will repair the gas and discover leak, supply authorizations, and collaborate with the city for final inspections. An energy company will find if there is a gas leak, however they do not locate the source of the leak or repair it.</p>
