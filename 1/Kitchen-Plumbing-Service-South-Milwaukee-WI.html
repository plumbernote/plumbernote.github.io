<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Bear in mind that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you should just employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture moisture so that it does not enter the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may get through a drip leg.</p>
