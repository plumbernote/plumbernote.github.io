<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
