<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

Your house will run more effectively, your monthly energy bills will remain low, and you will not have to shell out extra money for unanticipated and costly repairs.
