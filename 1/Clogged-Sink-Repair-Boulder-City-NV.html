<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are certain contaminants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help minimize those problems. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>
