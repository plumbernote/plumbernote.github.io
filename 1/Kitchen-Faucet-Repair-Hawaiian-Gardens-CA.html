Not just will they utilize water from any readily available source to achieve their objective, but fire department cars frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
