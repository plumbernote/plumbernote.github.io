<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require repairing the entire toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank features many little moving parts that might need replaced with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
