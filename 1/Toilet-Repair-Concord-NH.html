<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause obstructions and jams - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also. After completing cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
