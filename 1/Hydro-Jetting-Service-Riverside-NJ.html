<p>Water softeners normally have a lifespan of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved. Making certain the salt water tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the system.
