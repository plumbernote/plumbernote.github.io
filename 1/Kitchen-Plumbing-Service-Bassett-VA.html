<p>You reside in an older home. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
