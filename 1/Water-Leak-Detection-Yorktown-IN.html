<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
