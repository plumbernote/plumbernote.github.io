<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might have the ability to completely or partly eliminate copper, radium, manganese, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. If passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing, note that copper can reenter the water after.
