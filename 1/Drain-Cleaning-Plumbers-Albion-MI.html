<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
