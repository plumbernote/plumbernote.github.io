Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
