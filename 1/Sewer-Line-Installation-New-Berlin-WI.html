<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
