<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
