<p>If a cable television has actually not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time beforehand, joining the cable to the wires in the box just before or simply after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite easy to maintain. The most essential thing to keep in mind is that they are truly food disposals. Items that would otherwise enter the garbage needs to not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
