It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
