<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
