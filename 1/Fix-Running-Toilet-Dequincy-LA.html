<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
