<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
