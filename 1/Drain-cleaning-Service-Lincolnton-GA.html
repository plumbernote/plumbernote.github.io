<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing vents or take out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and may need extra costs. This is also not as reliable due to the fact that the drain machine loses torque the even more you are far from the clog.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding alternatives to the costly copper piping.</p>
