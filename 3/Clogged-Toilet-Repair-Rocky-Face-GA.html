<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
