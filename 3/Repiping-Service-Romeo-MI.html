<p>Toilet repair tends to freak many people out a little, which is totally easy to understand. No one wishes to mistakenly break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage. Nevertheless, the majority of toilet repairs are simple and basic jobs - such as changing a worn flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes. The most common question we run into regarding toilet repair is how to discover the best parts for your toilet. Sometimes this is easy, and in some cases it's not. Primarily it's easy though.</p>

<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can end up being corroded and worn, resulting in leaks. Depending upon the severity of the circumstance, only one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be removed and changed. Elements involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
