It's an easy repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then eliminate the old handle and lever, slide the new deal with into location, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
