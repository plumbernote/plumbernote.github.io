<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

It's quick and simple and more affordable than hiring a plumber.</p>
