<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
