<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Liberal KS</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
