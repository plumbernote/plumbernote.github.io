<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.

A basic manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
