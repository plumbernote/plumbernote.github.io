Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
