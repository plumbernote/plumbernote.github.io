<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
