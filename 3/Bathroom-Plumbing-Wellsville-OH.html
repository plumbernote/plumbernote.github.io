<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
