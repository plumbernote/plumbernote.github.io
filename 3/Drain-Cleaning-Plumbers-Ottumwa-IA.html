<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Ottumwa IA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
