<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers La Place LA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
