<p>It is estimated that the average individual invests over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and numerous bathroom readers are at risk of becoming permanently connected to the fixture. Which is why picking a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is incredibly essential. However, you have to ensure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
