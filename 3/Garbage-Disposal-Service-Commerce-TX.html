<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Everyone who's set up a couple of disposals knows this mistake: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system.

The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal correctly, producing waste and a greater water bill.</p>
