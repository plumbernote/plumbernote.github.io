<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Carthage NY</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
