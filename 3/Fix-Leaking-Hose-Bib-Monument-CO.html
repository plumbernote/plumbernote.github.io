<p>Heater Size: If your system is too small, it will not have the ability to heat water efficiently. And the harder your heater needs to work, the more it will be exposed to heats and make the tank breakable.

<p>Often brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve might activate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes slowly through the disposal.</p>
