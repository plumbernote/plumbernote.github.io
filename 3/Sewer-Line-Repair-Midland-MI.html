<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Midland MI 48640</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
