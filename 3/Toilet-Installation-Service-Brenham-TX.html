<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.
