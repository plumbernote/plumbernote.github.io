<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
