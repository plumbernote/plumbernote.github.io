<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
