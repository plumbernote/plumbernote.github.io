Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a new one is a relatively simple job. The work on individual mains normally takes one to 2 weeks, and service work typically takes an additional one to two weeks, though some may be performed concurrently on a task. However, the gas to your home will only need to be turned off for a short amount of time (typically less than 4 hours).</p>

<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing sufficient water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any readily available source to achieve their goal, however fire department automobiles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating offers a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause substantial problems and damage-- specifically typical in older homes. Using a sewer camera to examine the weak locations or clog, our extremely trained experts can quickly find the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- effectively transporting wastewater to your septic system or community system.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible option, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
