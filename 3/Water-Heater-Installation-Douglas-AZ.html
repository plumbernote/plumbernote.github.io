<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, plans for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to approve and process. Declined plans must be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must meet or go beyond the state standards and bring the responsibility for enforcing them.</p>
