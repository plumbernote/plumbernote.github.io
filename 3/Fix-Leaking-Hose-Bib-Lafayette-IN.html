An installed backflow preventer (blue device, center) safeguards the general public water supply from contamination. Depending on the brand and design of your toilet, a new tank can cost about $34-$ 255 from your local house improvement store to replace the old one.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
