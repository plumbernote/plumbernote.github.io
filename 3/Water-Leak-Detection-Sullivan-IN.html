<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation.
