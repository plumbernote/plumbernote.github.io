While you certainly want to get your kitchen faucet up and running again (you've got meals to do! Household to feed!), you do not wish to be or overpay caught with an unexpected expenditure.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
