<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Usually, this is since the system is obsoleted or not working appropriately. Whatever the reason, you can be missing out on the benefits of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

It is a fairly simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that turns at high speeds, which pulverizes the scraps. They pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of when they are small enough. If you have a battle drain setup, it typically takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on just one side.</p>
<p>Your company will call when the installer is on the method, typically about an hour prior to the arranged appointment time.
