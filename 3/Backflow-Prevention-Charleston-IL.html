If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Some consumers like to have softer water and select to install a water softening system. Again, it's individual preference and entirely up to the private customer.
