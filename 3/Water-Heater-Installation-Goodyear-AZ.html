Initially, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to approve and process. Turned down plans must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>
