<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
