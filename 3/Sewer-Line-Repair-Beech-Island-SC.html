<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Beech Island SC 29842</h3>
<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. In time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, especially if they are triggering major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the job possibly harmful. That makes it a great reason to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Property owners can either acquire the new disposal themselves and offer it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
