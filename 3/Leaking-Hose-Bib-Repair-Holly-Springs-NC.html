It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it too.</p>
