<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
