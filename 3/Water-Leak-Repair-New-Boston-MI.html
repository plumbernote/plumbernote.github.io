If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
