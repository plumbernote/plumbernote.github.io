<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
