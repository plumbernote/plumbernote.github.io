Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>It's an excellent concept to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience obstructions and backups in your house more than a couple of times.

<p>Galvanized metal, is simply an easier way of stating zinc coated" and what triggers galvanized pipes to rust is the direct exposure to too much water and minerals. You might be believing that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your house's main source of water transportation, and you would be right.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
