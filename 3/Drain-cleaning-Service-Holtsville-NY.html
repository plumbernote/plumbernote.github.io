<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
