<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>Usage of tankless systems in second homes removes risks of water damage. Traditional warm water tanks have danger of leaking, which can result in expensive damage repairs, particularly when left unattended.
