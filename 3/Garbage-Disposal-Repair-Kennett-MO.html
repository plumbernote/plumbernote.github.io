<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations.

<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
