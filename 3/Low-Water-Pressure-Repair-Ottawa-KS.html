<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. When searching for a new flapper, your best choice is to try and discover the same flapper that originally included your existing flush valve. The easiest way to do that is by looking up your toilet model and selecting the flapper suggested for that design. If you do not understand your design number, however, we do offer a substantial selection of "will fit" flappers to assist you out. Watch the video below to find out more about the different sort of flappers readily available, or go to How To Replace Toilet Flappers for short tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>

Because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
