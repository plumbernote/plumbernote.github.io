<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
