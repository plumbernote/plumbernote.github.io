<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Lawrence KS</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than typical (or perhaps more than once), this is a sign you might need a toilet repair or replacement.

No matter the cause, Vegas Valley Plumbing need to be called in to have a look at your toilet.</p>
