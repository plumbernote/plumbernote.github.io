<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a little more expensive however are also highly convenient, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to figure out correct maintenance schedules or the level of needed repairs.

The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
