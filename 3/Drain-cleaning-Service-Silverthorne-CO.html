<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair.
