<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Lancaster MA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>CALL Nicor Gas at 888. Nicor4U (888.642.6748) and emergency responders at 911 when you remain in a safe location, away from the area of the thought leak. Stay away until emergency personnel suggest it is safe to return.
