If you are on the fence about buying one, then there are a few things you should know.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
