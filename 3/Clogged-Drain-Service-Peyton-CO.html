<p>The heating component is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The factors for this can vary from leakages, malfunctioning or defective electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat.

However, if the water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a hot water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
