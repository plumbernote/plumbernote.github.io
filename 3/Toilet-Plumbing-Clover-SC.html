<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
