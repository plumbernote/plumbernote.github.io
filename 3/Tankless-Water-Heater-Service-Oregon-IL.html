<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
