<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
