<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
