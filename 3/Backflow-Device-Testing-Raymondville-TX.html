Our makers operate by snaking a rotating cable television with an attached blade through your pipes. The blades will dislodge the build-up due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign things. Our specialists don't require big holes to insert our devices through, instead of counting on entry points through drains, leading to a process that is minimally invasive, protecting your home and property.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink.

Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
