Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
