<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Big Bear City CA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Current policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
