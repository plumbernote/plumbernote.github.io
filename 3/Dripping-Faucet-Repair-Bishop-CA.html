Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television.
