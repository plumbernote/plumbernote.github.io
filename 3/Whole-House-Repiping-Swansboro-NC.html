<p>Tankless Water Heaters - provide hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can restrain the blades. Finally, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and ought to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
<p>Some consumers like to have softer water and choose to install a water softening system. Again, it's individual preference and totally up to the individual customer. Contact us immediately if you see any of these signs to have a Rainaldi plumbing professional check your water lines or pipes prior to its far too late. Our check-up, integrated with a preventive maintenance schedule, will guarantee your plumbing and drainage systems are working properly.
