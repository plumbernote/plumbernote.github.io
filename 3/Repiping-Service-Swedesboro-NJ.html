At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
