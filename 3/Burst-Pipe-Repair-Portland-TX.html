<p>If your assembly stops working the yearly test, you are accountable for changing the assembly or repairing within thirty days.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
