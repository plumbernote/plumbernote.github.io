<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Palmer MA 01069</h3>
<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. The pipes typically make odd gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with a lot of house owners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
