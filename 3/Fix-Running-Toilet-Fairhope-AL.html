<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
