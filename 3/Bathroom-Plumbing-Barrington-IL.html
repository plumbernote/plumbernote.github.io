In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Most energy companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg smell comes from. That way, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak. In most cases, when a garbage disposal unit is no longer working, the motor has failed, and the total cost of the repair will likely surpass the cost of installing a brand-new system.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
