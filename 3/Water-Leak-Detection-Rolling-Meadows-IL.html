<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
