<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.
