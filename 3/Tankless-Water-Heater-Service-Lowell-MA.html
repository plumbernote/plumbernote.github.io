<h3>Hot Water Heater Problems in Lowell Massachusetts</h2>
<p>When you hear the words whole-house repiping, you might be worried. It seems like a huge task. It is-- but this is why you work with professional plumbers to do the work. Whole-house repiping takes a couple of days, depending upon the size of your home, but plumbers with the tools and skills can make the work go smoothly and create as little interruption to your life as possible. And once the work is finished, you'll see a substantial enhancement in your house: fewer clogs, no water damage, lower water bills. The new plumbing must be there doing its job for decades.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Usually, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable design takes two to three hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old hot water heater. Placing the brand-new system takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and verify that all functions are up to code.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain specialist to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. This type of camera is particularly useful in locating a problem if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
