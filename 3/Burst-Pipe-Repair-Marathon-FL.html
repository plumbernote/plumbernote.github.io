<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
