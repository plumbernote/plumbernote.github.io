<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
