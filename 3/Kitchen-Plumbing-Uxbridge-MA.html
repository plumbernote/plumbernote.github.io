<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
