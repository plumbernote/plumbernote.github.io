<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair specialist knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

Increased security is likewise needed when chemicals are contributed to a fire defense system supplied by a potable water supply. Advise them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>
