<p>One common way for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem might spread tremendously. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in individual houses, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>At Apollo Plumbing Service, we incorporate this technology into much of our services, including hydro jetting, cars and truck wash particles extraction, excavation and trenching, utility potholing, tank cleaning, storm filter cartridge cleaning, tunneling, catch basin cleaning, and ruin or lose removal. This type of excavation improves our work and keeps home damage low and non-obtrusive for property owners. We make every effort to please our consumers, and our efforts to keep the procedure environmentally friendly and pain-free is an important component of our work.</p>
