<p>Frequently, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll observe the very same problems cropping up again and once again, even though you've had them repaired.

<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
