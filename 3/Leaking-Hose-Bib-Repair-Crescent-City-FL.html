<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a new or refurbished structure is installed by educated craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Obstructions in a component can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
