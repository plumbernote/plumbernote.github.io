<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
