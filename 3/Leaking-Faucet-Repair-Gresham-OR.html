<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller model that operated on the same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
