<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Mound MN</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in 2 fundamental types - continuous feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to run the unit. Constant feed prevails and the most convenient to utilize; a batch feed design is more secure however can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste because you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
