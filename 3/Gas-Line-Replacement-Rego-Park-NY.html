<p>A. Using phosphoric acid usually will help remove them if you have rust spots. If you would like to try the gentlest technique perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't suffice then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to read the directions and safety cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily offered at most hardware shops.</p>
