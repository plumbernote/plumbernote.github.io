<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.

Lastly, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
