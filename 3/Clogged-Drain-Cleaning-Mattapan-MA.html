<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

When to repair: Under no scenarios should your toilet move when you sit or press on it. If your toilet relocations, contact a plumber The toilet may not have actually been installed properly, in which case the plumber may need to tighten its bolts or replace the wax seal around its base.
