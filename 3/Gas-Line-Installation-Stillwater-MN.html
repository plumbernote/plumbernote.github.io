<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Stillwater</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and obligation are incredibly important to building a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a structure these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
