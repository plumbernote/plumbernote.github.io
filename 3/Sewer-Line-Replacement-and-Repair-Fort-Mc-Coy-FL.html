Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
