<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
