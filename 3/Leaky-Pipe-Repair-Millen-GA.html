Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system.

<h3>When To Call A Plumber Millen GA</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
