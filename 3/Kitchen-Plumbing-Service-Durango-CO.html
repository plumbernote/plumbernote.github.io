<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through. Because of the tight space, the pipes typically make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the yard above it to become soaked. You might smell the disgusting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it essential to cordon off that part of your yard. Because the swampiness will draw in unwelcome animals, the situation is fraught with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
