<p>Difficult water can leave your hair looking dull and dry and your skin feeling itchy and flakey, which's only what it does to your body. In your house, hard water mineral build-up on showerheads and faucets triggers them to lose efficiency and function, and etching and spotting on your glassware makes it appear like you never ever even ran the dishwasher.</p>
<h3>Clogged Sink Repair  in Greenville North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
