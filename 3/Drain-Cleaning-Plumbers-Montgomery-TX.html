<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
