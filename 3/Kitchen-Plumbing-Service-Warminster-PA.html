It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be offered.</p>

<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Warminster PA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
