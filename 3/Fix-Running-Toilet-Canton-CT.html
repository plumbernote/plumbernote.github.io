<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
