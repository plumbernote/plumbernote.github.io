Water will constantly flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

New meters must fulfill regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options.
