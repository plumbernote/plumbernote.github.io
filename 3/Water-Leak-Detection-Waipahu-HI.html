Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't wear out as fast.</p>
<p>Gradually, like any other home appliance in your home, your garbage disposal. may require repairs. A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage. A leak someplace in the system might suggest a used seal. Sometimes, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC truly enters play.
