<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Prospective impurities can then get in the potable water system. The best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
