Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
