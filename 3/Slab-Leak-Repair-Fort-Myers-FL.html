<h3>Sewer And Drain Cleaning in Fort Myers Florida</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
