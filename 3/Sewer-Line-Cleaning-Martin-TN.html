<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to remove wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had replaceable and easily removable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>
<p>Once per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we suggest that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least. It's also helpful because, at the exact same time, the plumber can expect the drains and suggest any drain repair, or drain cleaning company. Sometimes whatever is clogging the drain will not budge. It might be time to call a professional plumber if you have actually attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can determine the area of the obstruction and the very best ways to unclog the bottleneck without damaging your plumbing.</p>
