<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
