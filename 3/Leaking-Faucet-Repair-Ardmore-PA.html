<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause regular circulation to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
