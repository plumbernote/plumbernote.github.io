<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this kind of camera to identify and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly beneficial in finding a problem.</p>
