Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

A great deal of sink clogs that occur are much deeper than you may think, and the severity is so extreme that a typical store-bought drain cleaner or unscripted home drain cleaning treatment can not fix.</p>
