<p>While combating a fire, firemens are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any readily available source to achieve their goal, however fire department vehicles typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
