Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
