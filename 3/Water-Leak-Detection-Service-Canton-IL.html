<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, fortunately is that it does not always require a repair of your entire system. A toilet's tank is composed of numerous little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
