<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
