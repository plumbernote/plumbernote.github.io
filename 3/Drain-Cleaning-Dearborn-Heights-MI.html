<p>Backflow Preventers are an important component of any plumbing job with the function of keeping potable water different from any potential dangers through several applications.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
