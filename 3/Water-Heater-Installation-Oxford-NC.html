<h3>Dishwasher Hook Up in Oxford North Carolina</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public supply of water and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of defense for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
