<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a high-grade water softener, geared up with a high-performance resin that effortlessly reduces the most difficult of minerals. With a trademarked chlorine generator, our remarkable systems also offer an automated cleaning cycle. The CARIX ® ion exchange procedure (CArbon Dioxide Regenerated Ion EXchanger) allows for a purposeful partial desalination and for that reason softening of drinking water consisting of high amounts of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
<h3>Clogged Tub in Albion Michigan</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
