<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or service, and its capability to function is vital. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be an indication of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog.
