<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Lake Hiawatha NJ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
