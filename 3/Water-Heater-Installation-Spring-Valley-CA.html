Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to prevent the turnaround of the flow of water.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
