<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in flow.</p>
<p>Offer Edwards & Mills, Inc., a call at (336) 299-6309 or send us an email for advice, info, or to schedule a visit for us to install your new kitchen sink. Our knowledgeable, skilled personnel are here to supply a solution for any plumbing or gas-related need you may come across in the Greensboro, NC area. AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electrical or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are set up on each zone of the watering system, right away after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a private water supply goes beyond the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can cause normal circulation to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be carried out on all drains, including toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
