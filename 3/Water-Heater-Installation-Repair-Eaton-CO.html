<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Eaton Colorado</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
