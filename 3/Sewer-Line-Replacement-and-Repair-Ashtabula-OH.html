<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
