These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
