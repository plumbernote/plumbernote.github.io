<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade.
