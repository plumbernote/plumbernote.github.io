<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
