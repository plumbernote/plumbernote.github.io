<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

Consult your water softener dealership for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in truth, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that give water the rejuvenating taste many individuals find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
