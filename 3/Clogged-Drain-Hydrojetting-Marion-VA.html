<p>Many softeners have a bypass developed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's wise to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
