<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
