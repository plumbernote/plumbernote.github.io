<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
