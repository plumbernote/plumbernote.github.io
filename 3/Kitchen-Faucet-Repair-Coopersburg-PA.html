If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Leaking pipes: If you have water pressure problems throughout your house, the problem may be a leak in the main water line.
