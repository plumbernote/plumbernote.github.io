<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
