<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
