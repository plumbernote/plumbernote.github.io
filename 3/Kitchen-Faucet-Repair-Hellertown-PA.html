<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
