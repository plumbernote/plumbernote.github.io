<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.
