<p>You are accountable for changing the assembly or fixing within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly needs to fulfill the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be terminated until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed correctly (Image 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
