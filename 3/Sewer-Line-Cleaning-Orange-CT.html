<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public supply of water and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
