<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually correct, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a brand-new one is a relatively basic task.

Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it complimentary.

Depending on the severity of the situation, only one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and changed.

Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
