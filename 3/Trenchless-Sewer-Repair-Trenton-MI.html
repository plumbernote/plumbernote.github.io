<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the security, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Examining the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be serious issue. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house need to have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working effectively, you are off to a good start.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
