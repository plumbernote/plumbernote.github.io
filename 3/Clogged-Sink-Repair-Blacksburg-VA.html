Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.

The cost of the water softener system is considerably outweighed by the cash and energy conserved.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
