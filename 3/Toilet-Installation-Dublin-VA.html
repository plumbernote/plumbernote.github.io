<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Services Around Dublin VA</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
