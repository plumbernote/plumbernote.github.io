Sediment Accumulation: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Running out of warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.
