<h3>Slab Leak Reroute in Middletown Rhode Island</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
