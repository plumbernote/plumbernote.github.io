Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
