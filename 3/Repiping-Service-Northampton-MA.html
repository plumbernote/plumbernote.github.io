<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
