<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively since difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize a growing number of cleaning agent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
