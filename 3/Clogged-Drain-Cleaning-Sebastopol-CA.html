<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning gadgets have actually been marketed based on a variety of claims regarding their effect on water hardness and related scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not been able to figure out standards for these products and report inconsistent performance to date. Research study has actually shown no change takes place in the physical and chemical residential or commercial properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Job Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
