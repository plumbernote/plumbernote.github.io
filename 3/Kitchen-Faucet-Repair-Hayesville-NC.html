A toilet's tank is made up of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem.
