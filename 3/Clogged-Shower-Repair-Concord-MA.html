<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working effectively since tough water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regeneration. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
