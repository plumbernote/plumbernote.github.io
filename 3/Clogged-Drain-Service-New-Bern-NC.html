<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>The discharge tube consisted of in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
