<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental ways of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
