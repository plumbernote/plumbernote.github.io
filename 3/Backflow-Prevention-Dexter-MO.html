<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70.

Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
