Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water system and drain lines.

Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>
