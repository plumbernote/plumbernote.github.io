<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
