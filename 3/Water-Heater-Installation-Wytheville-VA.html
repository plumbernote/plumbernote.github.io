However sometimes even determining the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
