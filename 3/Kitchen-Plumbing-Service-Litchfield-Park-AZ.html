<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
