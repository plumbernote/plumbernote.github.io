<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
