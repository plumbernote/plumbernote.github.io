<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls.

If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
