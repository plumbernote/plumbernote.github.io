<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Stratford NJ</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
