<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
