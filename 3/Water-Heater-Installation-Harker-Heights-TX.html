<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Harker Heights TX</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
