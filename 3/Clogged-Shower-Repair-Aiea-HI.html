<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure authorization is usually needed before a plumbing license can be provided. Soften just what you need to. Individuals frequently pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps generally do not need to be connected to a softener. In most cases, people choose to soften just the warm water.</p>
