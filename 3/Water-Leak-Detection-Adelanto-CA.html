<p>Backflow is a prospective problem in a water system since it can spread out contaminated water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or actual connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or contaminants to go into the drinkable water system.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC.

The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
