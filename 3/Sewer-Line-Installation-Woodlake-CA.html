<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<h3>Broken Toilet in Woodlake California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
