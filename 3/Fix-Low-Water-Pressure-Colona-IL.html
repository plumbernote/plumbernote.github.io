<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively short. Crisp or soft foods are fine, but difficult or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads. While some older homes may not have backflow preventers, all newer residential or commercial properties are needed to have them.

We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Think about all the locations water flows in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional assessment should cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines ought to be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, a knowledgeable plumber aims to analyze the total health of your system. That suggests testing for correct water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can harm your plumbing, and insufficient can leave your house with dysfunctional water devices.</p>
