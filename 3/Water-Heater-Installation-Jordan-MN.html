If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue.

Hard water causes these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks simpler and less irritating for everybody involved.</p>
