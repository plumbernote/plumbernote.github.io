<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You need to likewise inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
