The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.

When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
