<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you need to only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture moisture so that it does not go into the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
