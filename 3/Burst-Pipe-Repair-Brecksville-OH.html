<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Numerous toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, don't require repairing the entire toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that might need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
