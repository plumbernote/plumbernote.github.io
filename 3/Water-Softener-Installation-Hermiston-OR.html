<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
