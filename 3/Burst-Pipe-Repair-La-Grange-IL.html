<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially get the needed authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can check out our Authorization page to find out more on getting a license. As soon as you obtain a permit you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you should call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is only equipped to deal with softer natural waste. If bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work correctly. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
