<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>In reality, that's how hard water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind.

The impacts of tough water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal look and comfort.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the proper precautions if using among these items.</p>
