<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
