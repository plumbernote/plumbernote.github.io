<p>E.R. Services understands the value of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Running out of warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Another difference between soft and tough water is dullness of your hair and clothes. If you have tough water, your hair might feel dull and lack body, and your clothing will begin to fade and may wear previously.
