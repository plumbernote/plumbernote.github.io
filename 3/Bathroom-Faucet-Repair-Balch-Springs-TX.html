<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
