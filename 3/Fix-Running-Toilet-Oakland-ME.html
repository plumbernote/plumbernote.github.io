Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
