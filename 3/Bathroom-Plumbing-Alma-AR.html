Items that would otherwise enter the garbage needs to not be put in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>

Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
