<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
