<p>The most effective method to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Softer clothes without tough minerals caught in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dull gray caused by hard water. We are a premier plumbing company prepared to service all of your plumbing requires. We provide a range of specials so you never ever need to pay more.
