If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
