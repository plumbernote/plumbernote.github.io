<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Since of the way galvanized pipes tend to break down over the years, replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is important. Galvanized pipe is made by finishing steel pipe with zinc. As time carry on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
