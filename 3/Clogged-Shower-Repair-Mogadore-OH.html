<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
