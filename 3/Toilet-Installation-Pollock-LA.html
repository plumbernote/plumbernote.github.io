<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
