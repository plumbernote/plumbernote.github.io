Applications range from softening in remote locations to attending to concerns of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given up horse power, or HP. These correspond straight to how much waste the system can handle, and suggested sizes are usually based on how many users remain in a household.

Setups must only be carried out by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
<p>If you are considering installing a brand-new hot water heater, consider going tankless. Garbage disposals must use a grounded outlet for power.
