<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
