<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are eliminated to attach the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood states. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the kind of structure, you may have one or more inspections.</p>

That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
