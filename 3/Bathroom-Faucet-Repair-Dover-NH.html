<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
