<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain due to the fact that they usually consist of grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it forms a strong residue and sticks to the pipes, clogging them. Call and arrange a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to validate that assembly is correctly installed. The toilet is the most made use of plumbing component in your home.
