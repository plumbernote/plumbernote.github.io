<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
