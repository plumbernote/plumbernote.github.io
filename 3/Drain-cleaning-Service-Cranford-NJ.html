Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
