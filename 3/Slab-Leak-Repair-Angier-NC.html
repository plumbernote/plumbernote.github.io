<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
