Sickness can result from ingesting water that has actually been infected due to backflow.</p>

This can cause your utility bill to shoot up and can be an indication that you need to install a new one.

For that reason, if your garbage disposal unit requires regular repairs, or it's old and doesn't work all that well, provide us a call. It may be time for waste disposal unit replacement.</p>
