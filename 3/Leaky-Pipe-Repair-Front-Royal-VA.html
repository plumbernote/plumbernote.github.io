<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger blockages and jams - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain also. After ending up cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside.
