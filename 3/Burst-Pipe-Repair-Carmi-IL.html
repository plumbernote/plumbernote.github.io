<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly simple system, regardless of their significance. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your organisation, where watering fulfills the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep track of the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.
