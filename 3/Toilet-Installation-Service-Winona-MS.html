<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale development in tough water systems. It is extremely challenging to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never based on tests that are well enough explained to permit others to evaluate them and to confirm the results. While the lack of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an important part of your home or business, and its capability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically but you can usually flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small blockages can become huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>
