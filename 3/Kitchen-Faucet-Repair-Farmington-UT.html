<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
