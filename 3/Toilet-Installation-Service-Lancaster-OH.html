<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
