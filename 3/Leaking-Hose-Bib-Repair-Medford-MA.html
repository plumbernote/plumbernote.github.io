Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To preserve your safety, health, and house convenience, we use just the very best piping: polyethylene. Numerous houses and businesses utilize galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to deteriorate and can adversely impact our health.
