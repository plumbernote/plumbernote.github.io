<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the lawn above it to become soggy. You may smell the disgusting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it needed to cordon off that portion of your yard. Since the swampiness will bring in unwelcome creatures, the scenario is fraught with problems. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>

Most plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that surface will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might affect the time it takes.
