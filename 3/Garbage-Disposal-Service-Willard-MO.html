<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building and construction contractors (or their employees).

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
