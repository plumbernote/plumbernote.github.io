<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
