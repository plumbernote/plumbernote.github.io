<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
