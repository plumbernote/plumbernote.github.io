<p>Surface Accelerated Formation is an invention that simulates biomineralization, the system frequently recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely get rid of short-lived firmness in water.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.
