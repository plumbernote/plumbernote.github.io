<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
