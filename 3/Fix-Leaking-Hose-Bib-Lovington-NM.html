<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
