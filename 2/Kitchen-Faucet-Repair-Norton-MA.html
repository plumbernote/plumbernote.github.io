The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors just and not indoors. When running the space-heaters, make sure somebody is awake to monitor them. Many families die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning overnight. Another preventative measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed areas.

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow.
