<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
