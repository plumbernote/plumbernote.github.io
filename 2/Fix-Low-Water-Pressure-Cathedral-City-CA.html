<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
