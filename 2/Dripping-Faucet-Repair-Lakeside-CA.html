<p>The best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure decreasing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters into the house. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the home will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
