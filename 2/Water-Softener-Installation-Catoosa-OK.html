<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
