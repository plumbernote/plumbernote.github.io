<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket beneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
