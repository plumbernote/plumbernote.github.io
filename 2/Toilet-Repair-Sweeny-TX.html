<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
