Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
