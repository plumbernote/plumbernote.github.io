If you're purchasing a house, this is twice as essential. Imagine in the above scenario knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a house. You can't constantly be certain whether the house has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner understood the factor for the clog A basic camera inspection might make you aware of a really pricey and surprise issue prior to the purchase.</p>
