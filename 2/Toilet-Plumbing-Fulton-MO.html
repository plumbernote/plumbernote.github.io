Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
