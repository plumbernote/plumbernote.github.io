If your tank is relatively brand-new and you have this problem, look for holes and damages. Examine your yard for any invasive tree roots. Transplant these plants, if possible, to keep roots away from your plumbing. Underground pipes can be expensive to repair or replace.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
