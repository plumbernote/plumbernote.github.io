<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
