<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to think of. Energy Performance. Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is a good idea. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF). The more efficient the hot water heater the greater the EF rating. However, just because a water heater has a greater EF value, it doesn't always mean it will have lower operating costs. You likewise need to think about the fuel source.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
