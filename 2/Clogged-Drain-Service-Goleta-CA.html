<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>In regards to the devices that will be checked, there are 2 possible choices: a reduced pressure concept device or check valves. Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were fantastic at fixing the clogged drain, but really extremely careless about repairing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
