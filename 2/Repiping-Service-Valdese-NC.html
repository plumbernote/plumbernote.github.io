<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
