It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

You can't constantly be particular whether the home has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous house owner knew the reason for the clog An easy camera inspection might make you aware of a surprise and extremely costly  problem prior to the purchase.</p>
