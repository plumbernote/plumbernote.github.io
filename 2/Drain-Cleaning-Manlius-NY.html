<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The most common problem with faucets is the leak and drip Not just can this take place in any location with a faucet such as cooking areas, restrooms, and more - however it can be a progressive problem that becomes a significant problem.
