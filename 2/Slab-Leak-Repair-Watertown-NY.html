<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Softer clothes without tough minerals caught in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites remain whiter without the dull gray brought on by tough water. We are a leading plumbing company ready to service all of your plumbing requires. We provide a variety of specials so you never need to pay more.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
