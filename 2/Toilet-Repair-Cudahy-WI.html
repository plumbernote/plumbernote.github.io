<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can help figure out if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the property, allowing it to stream backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
