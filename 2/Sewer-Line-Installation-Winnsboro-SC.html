He noted that there are specific impurities that citizens are handling and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally takes place in some soils which too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
