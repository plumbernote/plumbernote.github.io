However while small drips must not be trigger for concern, homeowners must keep an eye on the water heater leaks. I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was professional and friendly.

The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
