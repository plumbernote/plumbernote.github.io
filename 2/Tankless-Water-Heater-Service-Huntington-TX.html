<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
