Since of the tight space, the pipes typically make unusual gurgling noises as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the strange noises emanating from your sink.</p>

You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store.
