However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of cleaning agents and soaps.

Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
