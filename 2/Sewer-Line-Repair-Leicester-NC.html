<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Leicester</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
