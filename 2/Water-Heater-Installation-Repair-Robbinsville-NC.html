<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
