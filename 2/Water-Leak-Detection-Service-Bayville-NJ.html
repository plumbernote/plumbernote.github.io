<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
