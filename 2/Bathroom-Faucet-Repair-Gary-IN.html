<p>I can't say enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a very short amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every single person I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, communicated well, completely responsive and actually cared to help me through this extremely stressful task. All of the people I came across were role models for what a well run service organisation must be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're fantastic.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.
