Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
