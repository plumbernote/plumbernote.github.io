<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
