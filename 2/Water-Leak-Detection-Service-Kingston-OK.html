<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
