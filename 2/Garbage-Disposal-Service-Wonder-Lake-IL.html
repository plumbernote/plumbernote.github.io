<p>The traditional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature level of water that is not currently in usage.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
