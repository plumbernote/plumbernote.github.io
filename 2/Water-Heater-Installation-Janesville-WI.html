<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
