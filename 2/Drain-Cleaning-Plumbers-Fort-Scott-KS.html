<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
