<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Underneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the breeze ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.
