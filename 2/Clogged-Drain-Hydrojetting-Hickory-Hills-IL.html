<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
