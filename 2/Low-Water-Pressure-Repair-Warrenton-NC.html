Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
