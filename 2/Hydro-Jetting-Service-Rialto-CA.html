<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products containing harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>If a cable television has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the brand-new disposer whenever ahead of time, joining the cable to the wires in the box prior to or just after mounting the disposer.
