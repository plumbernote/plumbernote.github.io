Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that may need changed with usage in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and trigger toilet leaks that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
