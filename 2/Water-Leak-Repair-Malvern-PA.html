<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be reliable in preventing scale formation in tough water supply. It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never based upon tests that are well adequate explained to allow others to assess them and to validate the outcomes.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
