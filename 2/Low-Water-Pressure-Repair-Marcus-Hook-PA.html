<p>When the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
