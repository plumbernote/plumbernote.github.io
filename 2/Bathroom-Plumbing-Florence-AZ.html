<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of piping that are used in the repiping process. Copper piping and PEX piping are utilized because of their effectiveness, safety and cost. Copper piping avoids germs from growing within the pipe offering healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both lightweight and flexible. This material is resistant versus rust and will assist improve water pressure.</p>
