<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic option for the majority of people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only option.

Because of their toughness and other aspects, the new pipes that are utilized are normally made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
