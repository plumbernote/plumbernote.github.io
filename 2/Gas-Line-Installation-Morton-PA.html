<p>This is among the very first and main concerns that you need to ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your house is an important part to understand whether you should repipe your home.

If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was built years before that, opportunities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates.</p>
