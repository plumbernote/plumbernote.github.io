<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
