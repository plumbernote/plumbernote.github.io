<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>

Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
