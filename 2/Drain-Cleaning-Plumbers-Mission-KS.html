<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Mission KS</h3>
<p>Our team is dedicated to providing customers with only the best plumbing services to keep households running flawlessly. Avoid hard water from damaging your toilet and bathroom plumbing. Sodium ions also have a positive charge, but it is weaker, so when they are flushed through the tank with the calcium and magnesium ions, they press them out of the water.

<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually sodium. Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about really low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
