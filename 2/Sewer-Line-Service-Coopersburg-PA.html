<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
