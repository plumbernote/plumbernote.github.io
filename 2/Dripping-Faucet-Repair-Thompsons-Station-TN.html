<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their unclean or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to use and affordable, however they harm your pipes and their results are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
