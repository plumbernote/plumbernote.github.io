<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with hard water, you might not recognize how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
