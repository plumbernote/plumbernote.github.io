<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is generally detected before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continually leak out very slowly. Over time it can result in a significant build of water. Leaked water typically remains under the house and saturates into the ground soil. This can potentially cause a cavity if your home's structure was not appropriately compressed. This is an unusual event and in general, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
