<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>The Custom Select mixing valve enables you to adjust the solidity of the water so you can have your water, your way.
