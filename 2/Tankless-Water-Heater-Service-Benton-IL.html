<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less critical things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
