The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

Plumbing inspections make sure that water supply in structures are linked appropriately, with no cross-connection to contaminate drinkable water supply. Components should be properly caught, to prevent sewer gas from getting away into a structures.
