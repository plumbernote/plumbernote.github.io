Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
