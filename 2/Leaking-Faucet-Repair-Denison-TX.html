When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
