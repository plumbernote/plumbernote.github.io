Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects.
