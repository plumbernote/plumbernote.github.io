<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in location. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
