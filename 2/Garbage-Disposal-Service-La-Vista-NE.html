<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and examine the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you see water coming back in your sink or shower?
