<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Littlefield TX</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
