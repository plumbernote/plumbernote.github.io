<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't suffice then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the directions and safety warnings first!).
