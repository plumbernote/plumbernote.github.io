<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more prone and breakable to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and strains as a result of temperature change and ice development. And these distinctions dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
