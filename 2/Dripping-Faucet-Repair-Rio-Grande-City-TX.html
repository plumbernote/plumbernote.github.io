<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
