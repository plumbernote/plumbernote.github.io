The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a great concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and could ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
