<p>Gas is an important utility we use every day to keep our workplaces and homes warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the everyday use of gas, it is reasonable it is easy to understand that over time a leak is bound to occur.

<p>Though it's not always required, in some cases the plumber might need to upgrade or repair wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This generally costs an additional $50 to $100+.
