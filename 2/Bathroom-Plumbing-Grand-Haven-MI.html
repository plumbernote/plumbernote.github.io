<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water system. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
