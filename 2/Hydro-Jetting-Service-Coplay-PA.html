<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
