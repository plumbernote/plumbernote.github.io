<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you would like to attempt the gentlest approach possibly try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and safety cautions initially!), if that does not do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's easily available at most hardware stores.</p>

While repairs can fix a leak, it's often better to invest in a brand-new toilet. A leak can go undiscovered, triggering damage to your subfloor. If you need toilet repairs or are wanting to install a new unit, call 415-441-2255 and speak to Magic Plumbing. We can discover the service you're searching for.</p>
<p>You've got an issue with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you. This water is being disposed down the overflow tube squandering up to 200 gallons of water each day.
