Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally rare cases where the building is considered to not position a danger to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
