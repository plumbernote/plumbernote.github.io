<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
