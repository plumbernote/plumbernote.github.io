Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department should fulfill or exceed the state requirements and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
