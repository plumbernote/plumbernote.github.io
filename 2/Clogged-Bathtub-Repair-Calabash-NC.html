<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed throughout construction of a new or remodelled building is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.
