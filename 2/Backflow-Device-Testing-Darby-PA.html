<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
