<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working successfully since hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service.

Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
