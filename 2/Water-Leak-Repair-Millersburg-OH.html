<p>You rely on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. With time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most typical signs that your unit is at the end of its life expectancy, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
