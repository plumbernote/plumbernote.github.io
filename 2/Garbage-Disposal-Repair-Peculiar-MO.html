<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
