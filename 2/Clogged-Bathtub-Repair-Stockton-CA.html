<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn and need to be replaced.

<p>Installation and replacement costs are often equivalent, though replacement normally will not need additional charges, such as application charges. New meters must fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies might need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options. Layout - Once you add a second floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will utilize more materials which adds to your labor costs.</p>
