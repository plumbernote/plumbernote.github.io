<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Signal Hill CA 90755?</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
