<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
