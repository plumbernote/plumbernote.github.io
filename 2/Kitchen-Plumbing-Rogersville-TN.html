<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
