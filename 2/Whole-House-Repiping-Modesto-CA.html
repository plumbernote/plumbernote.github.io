<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
