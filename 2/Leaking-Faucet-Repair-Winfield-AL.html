<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
