<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
