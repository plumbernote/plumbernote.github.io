<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that makes sure non-potable water doesn't get back into the main water supply system.

You probably don't want to dig up your patio area, parking lot or landscape.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
