<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
