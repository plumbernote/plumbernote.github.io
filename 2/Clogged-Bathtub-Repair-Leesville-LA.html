<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually directed elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to clogging since there just isn't enough a high adequate circulation to flush out the debris.</p>
