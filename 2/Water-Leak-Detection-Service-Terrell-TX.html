<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
