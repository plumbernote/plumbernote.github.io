If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other 2 kinds of salts. When the brand-new salt has had a chance to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
