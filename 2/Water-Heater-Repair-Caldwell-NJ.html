<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist shut off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
