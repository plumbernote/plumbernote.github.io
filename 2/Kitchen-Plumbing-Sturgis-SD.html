This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The very best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
