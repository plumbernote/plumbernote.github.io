As hard water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the treated water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs.

Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
