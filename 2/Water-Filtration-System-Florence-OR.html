By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other dumping locations.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
