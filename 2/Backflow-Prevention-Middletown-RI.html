<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
