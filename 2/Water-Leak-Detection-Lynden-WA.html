<p>Many property owners believe their utility companies or homeowners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in a lot of cases you, the house owner, are responsible. The majority of fundamental homeowners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
