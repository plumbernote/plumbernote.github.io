<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or permanent connection between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
