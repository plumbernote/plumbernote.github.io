<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in.

Not that I would know from experience.</p>
