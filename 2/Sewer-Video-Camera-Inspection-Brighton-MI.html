<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually funnelled in other places to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.
