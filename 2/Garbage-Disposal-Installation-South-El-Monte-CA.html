Further, it must be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, maker specs, and engineering guidelines for the type of unit to be used.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
