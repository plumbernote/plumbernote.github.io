<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide decades of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature level, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might seldom need repair while some are fixed regularly. The test information from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>

Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered prior to it is turned on, or through a constant feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.</p>
