<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Each and every single individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, completely responsive and really cared to help me through this very demanding task. All of individuals I encountered were good example for what a well run service organisation should be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're great.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas device need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need an authorization and inspection.</p>
