<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Henderson KY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a risk to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
