Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
