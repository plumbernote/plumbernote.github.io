It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
