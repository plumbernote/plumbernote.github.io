<p>With PVC you have a number of choices if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to go ahead and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable option to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
