<p>While battling a fire, firemens are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention.

A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public supply of water.</p>
