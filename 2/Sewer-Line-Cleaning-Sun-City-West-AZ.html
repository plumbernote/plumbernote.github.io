How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right now.

That makes it a fantastic factor to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
