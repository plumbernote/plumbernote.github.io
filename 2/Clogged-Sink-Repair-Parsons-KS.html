If the trap continues to leak, take it out entirely and clean it thoroughly. You can choose to clear the drain with the aid of an auger if you presume an obstruction.

<p>The usual option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
