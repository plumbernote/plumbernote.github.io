You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District evaluates the use of each brand-new renter. The correction should be made prior to water service is allowed if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
