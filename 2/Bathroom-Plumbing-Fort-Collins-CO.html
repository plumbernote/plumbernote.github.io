<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
