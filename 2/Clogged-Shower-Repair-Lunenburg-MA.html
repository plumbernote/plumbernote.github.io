You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, odor, color or taste. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system.

Approximate. 1 hour work for 2 guys. There are a number of reasons you may need to call a plumber to come to your home and unclog drains.
