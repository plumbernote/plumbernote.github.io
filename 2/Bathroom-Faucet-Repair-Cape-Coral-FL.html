<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal ought to not leak. When this happens, it usually shows wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up.
