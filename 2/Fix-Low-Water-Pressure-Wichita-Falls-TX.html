<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
