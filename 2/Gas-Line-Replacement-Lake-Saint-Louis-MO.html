<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lake Saint Louis MO 63367?</h3>
<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to pass through. Because of the tight area, the pipes often make weird gurgling sounds as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the weird sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source offered to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome indicate that the level of defense on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high threat protection level.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating offers a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- especially common in older houses. Utilizing a sewer camera to examine the weak areas or clog, our extremely trained experts can quickly find the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- efficiently transferring wastewater to your septic tank or local system.</p>
<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
