<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
