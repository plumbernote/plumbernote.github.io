<p>Surface Area Accelerated Condensation is an invention that mimics biomineralization, the system commonly acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is accomplished with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of temporary solidity in water.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a homeowner.
