<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to fix the issue. Other times a more substantial service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve cash.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
