<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
