Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.

<p>You live in an older home. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

Tough water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to stress over any problems with mineral deposits staying.
