<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
