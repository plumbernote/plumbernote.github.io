<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of garbage does not need to enter the garbage can if it can easily and quickly be gotten rid of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
