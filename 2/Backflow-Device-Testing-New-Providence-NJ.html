<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
