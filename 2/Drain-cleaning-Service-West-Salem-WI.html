<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
