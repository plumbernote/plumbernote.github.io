<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
