Last but not least, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and ought to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>

This is in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be set up. You'll have the disposer unit, the sink-mounting assembly, an L-shaped tailpipe with mounting hardware, the sink stopper, and-- with some brands-- an unique hex wrenchette" that is utilized both for mounting the unit and for inserting into a hex hole in the disposer's underside when repair is needed to break free obstructions.</p>
