<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
