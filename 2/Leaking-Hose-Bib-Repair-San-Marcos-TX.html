No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke.

An approved backflow prevention device, which should be tested annually, should be installed on the service connection that the department has actually recognized as having a potential for backflow.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
