<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
