Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
