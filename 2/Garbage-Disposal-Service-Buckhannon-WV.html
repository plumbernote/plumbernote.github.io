<h3>Water Heater Service in Buckhannon West Virginia</h2>
<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
