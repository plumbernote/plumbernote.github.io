<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have actually a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
