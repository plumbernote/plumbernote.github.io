<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
