<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
