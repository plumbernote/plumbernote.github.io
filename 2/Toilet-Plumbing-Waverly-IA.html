Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

<p>This is among the very first and main questions that you should ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your home is an important element to understand whether or not you should repipe your house. This is not only because your plumbing has aged with time, but also because houses that were developed before a particular period are more likely to consist of galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was built before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Opportunities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was built years prior to that.</p>
