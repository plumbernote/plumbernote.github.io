However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur?

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
