<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
