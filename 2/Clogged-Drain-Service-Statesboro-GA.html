<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid typically will help remove them. If you want to try the gentlest technique perhaps attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke.
