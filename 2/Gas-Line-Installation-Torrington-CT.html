<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction result and draw prospective impurities into the drinkable (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are commonly found in most houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
