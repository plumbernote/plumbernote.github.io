<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. But discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are typically readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
