The city or Uruk includes the earliest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, constructed atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and easily removable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner.

If your commercial residential or commercial property currently has a backflow preventer, you are accountable for having it checked yearly by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List We will alert you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
