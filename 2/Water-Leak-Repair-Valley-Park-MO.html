<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the existence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative results and are, in fact, essential day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor lots of people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is stated to be difficult.</p>

<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides natural gas a smell frequently related to rotten eggs. If it happens, this distinct scent enables you to smell a potential leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
