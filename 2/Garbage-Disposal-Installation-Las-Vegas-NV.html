<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping process. Copper piping and PEX piping are used because of their security, effectiveness and cost.
