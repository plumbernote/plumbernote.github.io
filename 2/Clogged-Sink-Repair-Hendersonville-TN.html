<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Hendersonville TN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for the majority of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>
