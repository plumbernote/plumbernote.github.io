<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
