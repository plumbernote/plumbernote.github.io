<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a steady and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and after that examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
