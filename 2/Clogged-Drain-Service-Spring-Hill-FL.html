<p>Before the repair specialist starts the repair process, he should make certain he has examined the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any limiting conditions. Proper safety precautions must be followed for proper entry if the area is thought about a confined space. A appropriate and safe  work environment may entail the positioning of security barricades or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair service technician or the general public around your workspace are not harmed. This could impact the service technician's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is installed in a restrictive area.</p>
