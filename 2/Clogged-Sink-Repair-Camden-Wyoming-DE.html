This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential impurities can then enter the potable water system.

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
