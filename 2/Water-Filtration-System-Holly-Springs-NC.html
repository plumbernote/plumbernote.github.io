<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a stable and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. You should wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You should also inspect to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
