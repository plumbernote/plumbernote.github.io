<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
