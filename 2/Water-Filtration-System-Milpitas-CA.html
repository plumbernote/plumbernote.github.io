Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, especially if you are handling a little drain clog. However, they are generally temporary repairs that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>
