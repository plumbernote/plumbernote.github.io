Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
