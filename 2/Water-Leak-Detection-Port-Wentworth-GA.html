These products gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to eliminate.

<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it comes to pipe repair, the most costly aspects aren't the equipment or materials utilized, but the lawn, uprooting and landscaping damage that takes place.</p>
