<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
