<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
