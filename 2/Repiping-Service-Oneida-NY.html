<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout building of a new or remodelled structure is installed by well-informed artisans in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.
