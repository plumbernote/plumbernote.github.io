<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
