<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water supply and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of backflow systems: air space (AG) and lowered pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's approximated that each person utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a lot of water. In reality, it's a quantity that can send out a flood of dollars out of your wallet if you're counting on a broken or out-of-date water heater.</p>
