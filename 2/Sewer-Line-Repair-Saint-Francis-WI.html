<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing.

You should also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
