<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Created To Work. Many kitchen sink obstructions are because of heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the trash and utilize the disposal for the little particles that are left.

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
