<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
