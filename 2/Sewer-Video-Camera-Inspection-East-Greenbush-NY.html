When to repair: Under no scenarios must your toilet move when you sit or press on it.

<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies East Greenbush NY</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
