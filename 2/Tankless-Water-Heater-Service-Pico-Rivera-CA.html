<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
