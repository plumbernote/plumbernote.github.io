<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
