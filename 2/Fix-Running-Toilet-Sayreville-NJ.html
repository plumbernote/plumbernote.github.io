This repair approach is normally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or larger pipe.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are gotten rid of to attach the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood states.
