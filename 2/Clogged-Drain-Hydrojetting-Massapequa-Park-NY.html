<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Massapequa Park NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
