He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that residents are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
