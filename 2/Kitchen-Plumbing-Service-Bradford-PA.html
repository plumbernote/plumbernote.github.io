<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC focuses on the installation and repair of residential and commercial gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services.
