<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.

It is seldom used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly pricey, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.
