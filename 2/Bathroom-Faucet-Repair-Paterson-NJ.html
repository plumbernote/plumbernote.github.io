<p>Removing a Waste Disposal Unit - $26 - $37 for labor. This includes the cost for a plumber or handyman to switch off the water, detach the drain, cap the lines, disconnect the faucets and fittings, eliminate the sink from the base cabinet, and pile the particles onsite. Many potential home buyers are requesting drain inspections before they purchase a home.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Low warm water pressure? Our knowledgeable plumbers can recognize and fix your low water pressure issue. Indications of deterioration or scale accumulation on components may show past leaks and high pressure. This can lead plumbers to investigate if there is a larger problem requiring attention. Dealing with gas is very hazardous, and it is very important to turn off the line to allow for a safe repair procedure.</p>
