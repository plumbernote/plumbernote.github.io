<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
