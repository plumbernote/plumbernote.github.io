<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
