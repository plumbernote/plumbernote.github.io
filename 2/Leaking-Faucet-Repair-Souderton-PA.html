<h3>Bathtub Faucet Replacement in Souderton Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
