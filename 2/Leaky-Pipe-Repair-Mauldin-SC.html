<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
