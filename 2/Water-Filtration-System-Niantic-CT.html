<h3>Clogged Sink in Niantic Connecticut</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly.
