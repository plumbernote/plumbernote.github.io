<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
