Sediment Accumulation: If you discover strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
