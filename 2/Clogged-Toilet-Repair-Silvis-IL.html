Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
