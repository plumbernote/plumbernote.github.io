Electric ranges are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in reality, important daily nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating taste many individuals discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>

<p>The most effective method to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
