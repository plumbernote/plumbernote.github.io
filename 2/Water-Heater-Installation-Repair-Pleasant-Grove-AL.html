New meters should fulfill policies and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers may require a special meter for their services, restricting your choices. Design - Once you add a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will utilize more products which adds to your labor costs.</p>
