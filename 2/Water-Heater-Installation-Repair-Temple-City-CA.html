<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and constant efficiency of research study, vacuum, and commercial procedure systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This procedure includes coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leaks and corrosion within the line.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
