<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they used to be. Nowadays, property owners can choose from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, energy room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is usually an indication of a clog in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't removed, water pressure can develop within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
