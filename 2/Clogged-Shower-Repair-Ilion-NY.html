<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with tough water, you might not understand just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp.
