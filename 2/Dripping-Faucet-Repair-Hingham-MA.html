<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a residence is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite low-cost and easy to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease solidifies it adheres to the pipe and avoids water circulation, ultimately triggering a backup. This included with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
