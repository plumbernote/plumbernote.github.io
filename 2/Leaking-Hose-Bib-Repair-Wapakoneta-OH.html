<p>Frequently, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll see the same problems cropping up again and once again, despite the fact that you've had them fixed.

<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can often establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are attached to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will leak into the cabinet below. A reduced pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it comes to backflow preventers, and is the device of choice because it can withstand the intro of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a sensible option for residential water supply.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
