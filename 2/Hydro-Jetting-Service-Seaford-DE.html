<h3>Drain Cleaning Company in Seaford Delaware</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller sized model that operated on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
