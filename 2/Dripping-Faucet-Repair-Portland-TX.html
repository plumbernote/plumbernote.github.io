<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
