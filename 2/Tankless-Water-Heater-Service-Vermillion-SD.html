Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
