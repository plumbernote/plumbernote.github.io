If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
