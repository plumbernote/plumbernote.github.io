<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Riverbank CA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately kept. Making sure the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
