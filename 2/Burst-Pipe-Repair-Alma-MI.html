Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
