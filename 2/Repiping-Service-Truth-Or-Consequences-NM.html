<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl).
