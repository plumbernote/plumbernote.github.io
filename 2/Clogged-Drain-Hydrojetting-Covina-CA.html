<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
