<p>Pipeline video inspection is a kind of telepresence utilized to visually check the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to figure out the condition of small size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.

Under the sink, place a pail or pan underneath the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>When you purchase a brand-new disposal, the box will contain all the parts you need to install it.
