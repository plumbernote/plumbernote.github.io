<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

It needs more than just elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is often due to how troublesome it is to assess the damage. This is a lot more bothersome if the damage is irreversible or needs more comprehensive repair work, particularly in commercial settings.</p>
