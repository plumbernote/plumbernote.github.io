<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become lodged in between your drain and your pipes. These will eventually block the flow of your water before triggering a clog. Likewise, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic items are flushed, a clog can occur. Thermostat concerns: The thermostat controls the temperature of the hot water heater. You might be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this component malfunctions.</p>
<p>Leaking pipes: If you have water pressure problems throughout your home, the problem may be a leak in the main water line.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened.
