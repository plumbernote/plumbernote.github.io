Residences integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health hazards associated with lead.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
