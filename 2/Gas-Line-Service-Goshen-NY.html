Gas Appliances Malfunctioning: Another common indication that your gas line may be harmed is if you see the malfunctioning of home appliances in your home that are powered by gas.

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
