<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).
