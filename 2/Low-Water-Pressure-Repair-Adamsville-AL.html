<p>There are certain plumbers who concentrate on plumbing associated with home remodeling and brand-new building. When a new house is built, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a terrific candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber must be used for house remodeling work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
