The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
