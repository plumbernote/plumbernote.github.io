<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Plymouth NH</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally uncommon cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
