<p>Check the home's warm water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be warmed and readily available for usage.
