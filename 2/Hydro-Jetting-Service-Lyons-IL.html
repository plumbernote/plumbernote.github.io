Often times basic repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a fixed cost of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your situation and inform you what needs to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be deducted from the bill.
