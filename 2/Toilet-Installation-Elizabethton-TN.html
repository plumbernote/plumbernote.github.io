<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
