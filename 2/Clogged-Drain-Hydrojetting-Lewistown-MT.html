<p>The most reliable method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Usage of tankless systems in second homes eliminates dangers of water damage. Traditional hot water tanks have danger of leaking, which can cause expensive damage repairs, particularly when left ignored. A tankless water heater has no threat of leaking a full tank of water and triggering damage.
