This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
