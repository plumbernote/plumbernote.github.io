<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and contaminating the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
