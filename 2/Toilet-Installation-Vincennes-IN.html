<p>When utilized in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in securing people's lives and to a lesser degree their residential or commercial property.

This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result suggest that the level of protection on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>

When you find that your faucet simply isn't working, you might require faucet repair. Whether you have a leaky faucet and need leaky faucet repair, or you need a new faucet, our service technicians can manage it all.</p>
