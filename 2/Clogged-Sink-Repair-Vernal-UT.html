<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
