Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>
